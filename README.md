[![License: MIT or Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT_or_Apache_2.0-634f7d.svg?style=for-the-badge)](LICENSE-APACHE)

A strictly typed scripting language for creating GUIs. Uses [`cranelift`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift) for JIT compilation.

It is still at a fairly early stage of development.
